CONNECT FOUR!

Gameplay:

We're presented with a grid, the goal being to match four colors in a row before your friend does. Don't feel bad about humiliating them. They propbably have it coming anyway.

Don't forget, though, to think creatively in your quest to crush your enemies. Not only can you achieve this goal by making vertical and horizontal connections, but diagonal ones, as well! They won't even see you coming!

Creation Process:

Just the basic mechanics were far more complex than I imagined. Styling the grid itself involved learning more than I had up until this point. I intially wanted a series of buttons written in HTML that would act as my gameboard. In retrospect, I probably could have gotten away with using just one button looped through a series of arrays. Regardless, after consulting with those way smarter, I ended up with an </svg> tag (scalable vector graphic -- used to create simple 2D graphics). Manipulating the </svg> from the JavaScript file was baffling and I still struggle to wrap my head around it.

Moving the player around the grid and stacking colors upon one another was easier to understand, but attempting to map out the winning conditionals resulted in yet another roadblock. I'm very grateful for supporting teachers, students, and the developer community in general that helped me through this. 

In conclusion, I was hoping this project would push me beyond my current experience so that progressing through my studies would go more smoothly. Whether or not that has occured, I can't say at this point. I do, though, feel more experienced than I did at the beginning of the project, and feel I've made steps into thinking more programatically.
